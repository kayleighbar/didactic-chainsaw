It wasn't until recently when Sophie actually became the face of work. When she first started making music, she was seldom seen. She did not care to be the face of her music, but rather let the work speak for itself. Her compilation album <i> PRODUCT </i> focused around creating sounds for objects that did not exist.
With these albums she bundled a bunch of different "products" including a puffer jacket, platform shoes, and a sex toy.

In the video, SOPHIE appears naked and is emotionally singing and dancing to the song with clouds behind her.
